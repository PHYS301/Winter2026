Your team will work on problems in class, discuss the content, and turn in a weekly problem that you solve together.

If you do not complete it prior to class, you must work alone to finish the assignment before you can join your team.\nNot all of the work will be in groups. You will also have individual quizzes and homework. You can work with other students on your homework, but you must submit and self-assess your own homework.\nI have tried to balance the class so that there is a mix of individual and group work, which I hope will allow everyone to get something meaningful out of the course.",

Your performance on each bundle determines your rough letter grade (full letters). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each bundle below:\nPCQs\nWHWs\nGroup problems\nWeekly quizzes\nCommunity engagement\n\nGrading Scheme\n\n\nTable of letter grades\n\nLetter grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter grade\nPre-Class Questions (PCQs)\nWeekly Homeworks (WHWs)\nGroup Problems (x12)\nQuizzes (x10)\nCommunity Engagement\n\n\n\n\nD\nEarn 75% of points\nEarn 75% of points\nAt least M on 6\nAt least M on 5\nAt least M on 1 module\n\n\nC\nEarn 75% of points\nEarn 75% of points\nAt least M on 9\nAt least M on 7\nAt least M on 2 modules\n\n\nB\nEarn 75% of points\nEarn 75% of points\nAt least M on all 12\nAt least M on 9, plus 2 Es\nAt least M on all 3 modules\n\n\nA\nEarn 75% of points\nEarn 75% of points\nAt least M on all 12, plus 2 Es\nAt least M on all 10, plus 4 Es\nAt least M on all 3 modules\n\n\n\n\n\nBundle visualization\n\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPointsE/M/U/N\n\n\nHomeworks and pre-class quizzes will be graded on a points scale. Your total grade for the bundle will be your average points on the assignments.\n\n\nQuizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale\n\nE: exceeds expectations\nM: meets expectations\nU: unsatisfactory / does not meet expectations\nN: no submission\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. To get an A or B in this class, you must achieve some Es (see the grading scheme)\nU and N are considered failing grades.\nIn the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have chances to revise (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.\nUnder no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect – turn your work in so you can receive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nPCQsWHWsGroup problemsWeekly quizzesCommunity engagement\n\n\nIn order to get the most out of class and be a good team member, you need to prepare. To do this, we will have daily reading and pre-class questions, which are google forms that ask you a few questions about the reading and ask you to work through a warm-up problem, which you must submit prior to class start. These are graded on a points scale, but all I ask is that you show a good-faith effort to get full credit. You do not have to solve the warm-up problem correctly, and you will go over it with your group in class.\nGiven the purpose of the PCQs, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\n\n\nRegular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a short weekly problem set as well as a self-reflection form.\nYou will turn in the weekly problem set by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Lyceum. These are due by class time each Wednesday. You will then have a self-reflection due 48 hours later (by class time on Friday).\nThe weekly problem sets are self-graded. Here’s how that works:\n\nYou get 50% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.\nWhen you submit your work, you will receive access to the solutions.\nThe rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions and filling out a guided self-reflection form.\nThese forms are not intended to make you do “extra work” – these are to help both you and me understand where you need more practice and more support.\n\nYou may request extensions on the WHWs using the extension form.\n\n\nEach week, your team will be responsible for completing and doing a formal write-up of one problem. You will submit one write-up together on Lyceum, which must be type-set and clearly organized. You may type-set using LaTeX/overleaf, Google docs, or any other word processing software that can handle mathematical expressions. For each part, make sure you include at least one sentence that describes the reasoning/explanation for the math you applied.\nThis will be graded on correctness, thoroughness, and clarity, and will receive a grade of E, M, U, or N. Only an U can be revised on the group problems\nEach problem is graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades.\nYou may request an extension as a group on these problems using the extension form.\n\n\nThere will be a closed-book quiz each week on Friday. These will mostly focus on recent content, but may sometimes require that you use skills from previous units.\nIf you have to miss class or leave early on a Friday due to an approved excuse, you may take the quiz at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before the quiz is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e. starting the Wednesday before the quiz and ending the Wednesday after the quiz), and you can request this option through AESS using this form. If you are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the options.\nQuizzes are graded on an E/M/U/N scale. Each quiz will have a clear rubric of which learning objectives are being assessed and how to achieve an M or E on the quiz. You may submit corrections for regrading once, and you must do this within 3 weeks of the quiz date. The grade expectations are slightly higher for a corrected quiz, and you must also submit a reflection. Details will be posted in Lyceum for each quiz.\n\n\nAt the end of each module, you and your peers will fill out a form where you provide feedback on your teammates’ contributions and your own. Your self-assessment and your peers’ assessments will be weighted equally in the grade, and I will also take into account your participation in pre-class quizzes and your in-class attendance in order to determine a final grade for each module.\nThese are graded on an E/M/U/N scale. Not submitting your own form will result in an “N” regardless of how your team rates your participation.\nI recognize that group work and peer grading can be fraught. I have been in many difficult group projects myself, and as a queer woman in physics, I’m not unaware of cultural and social biases that exist in our field. If there are any concerning dynamics in your group, I hope that you feel safe talking to me in addition to including that information in your feedback form. You may also fill out my anonymous feedback form and give me only the information you think I need to address this issue anonymously.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading boosts\nYour base grade will be calculated from the table above, but you can round your grade up in a number of ways.\nI will apply as many grade boosts as you achieve, with one exception:\nYou can only achieve an A+ in this class if you receive a base A grade. The A+ grade does not have an impact on your GPA, and so I am reserving it as a way of acknowledging especially excellent work across the course of the semester.\n\nCommunity BuilderQuiz CrusherTime ManagementGrowthMetacognition\n\n\nIf you receive all Es on your community engagement, I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you get all Es on quizzes (revisions are allowed), I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you use no more than 3 extension requests all semester (on individual assignments), I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I reserve the right to round your grade up.\n\n\nIn order to get this boost, you must do 5 of the following 7 assignments:\n\nRead an article on growth mindset and reflect on how it applies to your own life\nFill out the first week of class form before the end of January\nSet a SMART goal (this will be evaluated on whether it meets the criteria) for a study skill to improve. You must do this before the end of January.\nFill out the mid-semester survey before the end of February Recess\nSchedule an appointment with a learning strategies tutor at SASC and write a reflection on one thing you learned at that meeting\nBring questions to SASC at least once and write a reflection about your experience\nCome to my office hours at least once and write a reflection about your experience\nReflect on your SMART goal at the end of the semester\n\nThese assignments will all be posted in Lyceum under the “Metacognition” tab.",

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only way I can help is if you communicate with me. Extension requests are always due before the deadline. Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will not be graded.\nIn general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some assignments will have stricter deadlines, which are discussed in their descriptions above.",
