Before Bates, I was at Smith College in Physics and Statistical and Data Sciences. And long before that – before I went to school for physics and computational science – I studied philosophy, film production, and Spanish and worked in the film industry. It took me a long time to find my way to physics, but I wouldn’t change any of it. The long and winding path taught me so much more about who I am, what I am capable of, and how many opportunities are available in the world. It also taught me that it’s never too late to find a new passion or change your career direction.\nMy research involves applying high performance computing and data science techniques to many-body quantum systems, which just means studying how medium-to-large numbers of quantum objects like electrons, neutrons, or atoms interact with each other and their environment. This sounds straightforward, but unfortunately the mathematics of quantum mechanics means these problems become impossible to solve by hand and extremely challenging to solve even with high powered computers when the system is still only a few particles.\nOutside of physics, I am a person with lots of interests and hobbies. I love being outdoors in all seasons, but also love reading a book inside with a cup of tea. Ask me for book recommendations, recipes for interesting food, or great hikes in Maine!",

Your team will work on problems in class, discuss the content, and turn in a weekly problem that you solve together. At the end of each module, you will provide feedback on your teammates and on your own work, and then we will shuffle the groups, so you will have three different teams over the course of the semester.\nIn order to be a good member of your team, there will be a reading quiz and short warm-up problem (the PCQ) that must be completed prior to class. If you do not complete it prior to class, you must work alone to finish the assignment before you can join your team. I will take into account your attendance and whether you did the PCQs prior to class when assessing your community engagement for the module.\nNot all of the work will be in groups. You will also have individual quizzes and homework.\nI have tried to balance the class so that there is a mix of individual and group work, which I hope will allow everyone to get something meaningful out of the course.",

    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nAssignments fall into “bundles,” which contribute to your grade equally. Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each bundle below:\nPractice\nGroup Work\nQuizzes\nExcellence\n\nGrading Scheme\nAt the end of the term, you will earn a letter grade for this course. That letter grade will be determined following the Four-Square grading chart (below). Each square represents a grading bundle, and you can earn a score of 0-4 for each bundle. At the end of the term, I will calculate an average score for you using the following equation:\nOverall Score = (Practice score + Group Work score + Quizzes score + Excellence score) / 4\n\nThe resulting overall score will correspond to a letter grade using the Bates College 4-point GPA table. You can then get up to three grade boosts, each of which rounds your grade up (e.g from a B to B+ or from an A- to A). The grade boosts are described more below.\nIf, for example, you achieved a 2 in Practice, a 4 in Group Work, a 3 in Quizzes, and got a total of 11 “Es”, your base grade would be (2.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 2.0)/4 = 2.75, which would be a B-. With round-ups, your grade could go up to a B, B+, or A-.\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPoints and CompletionE/M/R/N\n\n\nHomeworks will be graded on a points scale, and PCQs on whether you completed them (regardless of “correctness”).\n\n\nQuizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale\n\nE: exceeds expectations\nM: meets expectations\nR: revise / retry\nN: no submission\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will contribute to your overall grade (see the grading scheme)\nR and N are considered failing grades.\nIn the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.\nUnder no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect – turn your work in so you can receive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nPracticeGroup WorkWeekly quizzesExcellence\n\n\nPCQs: In order to get the most out of class and be a good team member, you need to prepare. To do this, we will have daily reading and pre-class questions, which are google forms that ask you a few questions about the reading and ask you to work through a warm-up problem, which you must submit prior to class start. All I ask is that you show a good-faith effort to get full credit. You do not have to solve the warm-up problem correctly, and you will go over it with your group in class.\nGiven the purpose of the PCQs, I will not offer extensions or revisions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\nWHWs: Regular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a short weekly problem set, which will be graded by a grader.\nYou may request extensions on the WHWs using the extension form.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nEarn &gt;= 90% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 90% of PCQs\n\n\n3.0\nEarn &gt;= 80% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 80% of PCQs\n\n\n2.0\nEarn &gt;= 70% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 70% of PCQs\n\n\n1.0\nEarn &gt;= 60% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 60% of PCQs\n\n\n0.0\nUnder a 60% average on WHWs OR under a 60% average on PCQs\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Problems: Each week, your team will be responsible for completing and doing a formal write-up of one problem. You will submit one write-up together on Lyceum, which must be type-set and clearly organized. You may type-set using LaTeX/overleaf, Google docs, or any other word processing software that can handle mathematical expressions. For each part, make sure you include at least one sentence that describes the reasoning/explanation for the math you applied. This will be graded on correctness, thoroughness, and clarity, and will receive a grade of E, M, R, or N. Group problems receiving an R may be revised once.\nYou may request an extension as a group on these problems using the extension form.\nCommunity Engagement: At the end of each module, you and your peers will fill out a form where you provide feedback on your teammates’ contributions and your own. Your self-assessment and your peers’ assessments will be weighted equally in the grade, and I will also take into account your participation in pre-class quizzes and your in-class attendance in order to determine a final grade for each module.\nThese are graded on an E/M/R/N scale. Not submitting your own form will result in an “N” regardless of how your team rates your participation.\nI recognize that group work and peer grading can be fraught. I have been in many difficult group projects myself, and as a queer woman in physics, I’m very aware of cultural and social biases that exist in our field.

    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nAssignments fall into “bundles,” which contribute to your grade equally. Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each bundle below:\nPractice\nGroup Work\nQuizzes\nExcellence\n\nGrading Scheme\nAt the end of the term, you will earn a letter grade for this course. That letter grade will be determined following the Four-Square grading chart (below). Each square represents a grading bundle, and you can earn a score of 0-4 for each bundle. At the end of the term, I will calculate an average score for you using the following equation:\nOverall Score = (Practice score + Group Work score + Quizzes score + Excellence score) / 16\n\nThe resulting overall score will correspond to a letter grade using the percentage table below:\n\nGrade table\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n97-100%\n\n\nA\n93-96.9%\n\n\nA-\n90-92.9%\n\n\nB+\n87-89.9%\n\n\nB\n83-86.9%\n\n\nB-\n80-82.9%\n\n\nC+\n77-79.9%\n\n\nC\n73-76.9%\n\n\nC-\n70-72.9%\n\n\nD+\n67-69.9%\n\n\nD\n63-66.9%\n\n\nD-\n60-62.9%\n\n\nF\nless than 60%\n\n\n\nYou can then get up to three grade boosts, each of which rounds your grade up (e.g from a B to B+ or from an A- to A). The grade boosts are described more below.\nIf, for example, you achieved a 3 in Practice, a 4 in Group Work, a 3 in Quizzes, and got a total of 16 “Es”, your base grade would be (3.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 3.0)/16 = = 81.3%, which would be a B-. With round-ups, your grade could go up to a B, B+, or A-.\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPoints and CompletionE/M/R/N\n\n\nHomeworks will be graded on a points scale, and PCQs on whether you completed them (regardless of “correctness”).\n\n\nQuizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale\n\nE: exceeds expectations\nM: meets expectations\nR: revise / retry\nN: no submission\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will contribute to your overall grade (see the grading scheme)\nR and N are considered failing grades.\nIn the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.\nUnder no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect – turn your work in so you can receive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles (#assignments)\n\nPracticeGroup WorkWeekly quizzesExcellence\n\n\nPCQs: In order to get the most out of class and be a good team member, you need to prepare. To do this, we will have daily reading and pre-class questions, which are google forms that ask you a few questions about the reading and ask you to work through a warm-up problem, which you must submit prior to class start. All I ask is that you show a good-faith effort to get full credit. You do not have to solve the warm-up problem correctly, and you will go over it with your group in class.\nGiven the purpose of the PCQs, I will not offer extensions or revisions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\nWHWs: Regular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a short weekly problem set, which will be graded by a grader.\nYou may request extensions on the WHWs using the extension form.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n4.0\nEarn &gt;= 90% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 90% of PCQs\n\n\n3.0\nEarn &gt;= 80% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 80% of PCQs\n\n\n2.0\nEarn &gt;= 70% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 70% of PCQs\n\n\n1.0\nEarn &gt;= 60% average on WHWs AND complete &gt;= 60% of PCQs\n\n\n0.0\nUnder a 60% average on WHWs OR under a 60% average on PCQs\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Problems: Each week, your team will be responsible for completing and doing a formal write-up of one problem. You will submit one write-up together on Lyceum, which must be type-set and clearly organized. You may type-set using LaTeX/overleaf, Google docs, or any other word processing software that can handle mathematical expressions. For each part, make sure you include at least one sentence that describes the reasoning/explanation for the math you applied. This will be graded on correctness, thoroughness, and clarity, and will receive a grade of E, M, R, or N. Group problems receiving an R may be revised once.\nYou may request an extension as a group on these problems using the extension form.\nCommunity Engagement: At the end of each module, you and your peers will fill out a form where you provide feedback on your teammates’ contributions and your own. Your self-assessment and your peers’ assessments will be weighted equally in the grade, and I will also take into account your participation in pre-class quizzes and your in-class attendance in order to determine a final grade for each module.\nThese are graded on an E/M/R/N scale. Not submitting your own form will result in an “N” regardless of how your team rates your participation.\nI recognize that group work and peer grading can be fraught. I have been in many difficult group projects myself, and as a queer woman in physics, I’m very aware of cultural and social biases that exist in our field. If there are any concerning dynamics in your group, I hope that you feel safe talking to me in addition to including that information in your feedback form.

    "text": "Technology Policy\n\nUse of LLMs\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are here to stay, but we should be discerning about how we use them. Banning them from the classroom is both pointless and actively unhelpful. If you are going to use ChatGPT or a similar LLM in this class, I only require two things:\n\nThat you do a little reading on Large Language Models. Specifically, read\n\n\nthis article about how LLMs actually work\nthis article about the ethical considerations around LLMs and intellectual property\nthis article about just one of the many environmental impacts of LLMs\n\n\nThat you consider the LLM a source that you must cite. If you use generative AI to help with any assignment, you must acknowledge that help and give a short (two-sentence) description of what the LLM did for you and how it helped you solve the problem.\n\nRemember that LLMs are designed to predict the most probable response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to “hallucinating” (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can’t do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are trying to develop in this class.\n\n\nUse of technology during class time\nTechnology is completely infused into our lives, and I’m not trying to convince anyone to stop using it. As a computational physicist, it’s my literal vocation to use digital technology, and as a teacher, I spend many hours a day staring at my screen to write lesson plans and respond to emails. But it’s important to know that as useful a tool as technology is, it can also inhibit us.\nFirst, the science. While we all believe ourselves to be excellent multitaskers (okay maybe that’s hyperbole), studies show that we can’t actually focus on more than one thing at a time - what we are doing is actually rapidly task switching between one task and the next, and that task switching takes time and energy, making us do both tasks more poorly. This means that if you’re toggling between your email, social media, text messages, or whatever other content might be up on your laptop, phone, or tablet in class, you are going to have a harder time learning the content in class and a harder time doing whatever else you are trying to do. In addition, studies have found that merely being in the presence of our smartphones can cause us to be distracted by them.\nI have found this to be extremely true, and as a general rule, if I’m working on something that requires my focus, such as writing a lesson plan or working on research projects, I have a box in my office that I put my phone in so I can’t be distracted by it.\nOur goal in this class is to learn, and class time is an important time set aside for us to meet together in community to work towards the learning goals. In order to make sure you get the most out of that time, and to help support your classmates to not be distracted, I ask that you do the following:\n\nKeep your phone on silent and out of view throughout the duration of class\nClose all windows on your laptop or tablet that are not either your notes for the class, the Lyceum page or website for the class, a Mathematica notebook, or a PDF of the textbook\n\nIf the second one feels intimidating (what if you lose a window that was important for something you need to do later?), look into browser extensions that allow you to save tabs for later, like Mozilla Session Manager for Firefox or OneTab for Chrome.\nAll that said, I recognize that sometimes we have situations that require us to be reachable, so if you have a special circumstance that means you need to be able to take a call when it comes in, please talk to me about an exception to this policy.\nSince this policy is intended to support all members of the community, I will ask that we all work together to encourage each other to remain present during our class time. To do this, here is how we will put this policy into practice:\n\nIf you find yourself distracted by something on your computer, please\n\nacknowledge it\napologize if this occurred during group work (this doesn’t have to be a drawn out apology, just “I’m sorry, I got distracted, but I’m back now”)\nremove the distraction and return your attention to class.\n\nIf you notice your classmate is distracted, please\n\nacknowledge what you see gently (“Hey, I notice you’re checking your email right now”)\nthank them for returning their attention to the task at hand\nmove ahead with what you were doing (don’t make it a big event)\n\nIf I notice someone is distracted once (including having tabs open that are not relevant to the class), I will\n\nacknowledge it as discreetly as I can\nask you to close the distraction\n\nIf I notice someone is repeatedly distracted by the same thing during one class session, I will\n\nnote the previous instances\nask you to put away whatever device the distraction was on. If this means you need paper to take notes on, I will provide that.\n\nIf the distraction recurs over the course of the semester, it will affect your community engagement grade",

    "text": "Can the syllabus change?\nYes, under certain conditions. The schedule may change in small ways – this will happen if there is a disruption in the schedule (e.g. I am sick and have to cancel class, a snow day prevents us from meeting, some other emergency or surprise causes class to be cancelled). More often, what will happen is we will need a little more time on a topic, and I will push other topics a day or two. I build in a number of “catch-up days” into the schedule in order to make sure that when this happens, it doesn’t require a total rewrite of the class.\nThe syllabus may also change if we agree together as a class to cut or modify an assignment, or if I determine that the grading scheme has set the bar too high. I will never modify assignments or grading in a way that harms your grade, and if a change to either of those has you concerned, please come talk to me and we will determine together a reasonable alternative if that is needed.\nFinally, I reserve the right always to modify typos, etc. If you spot one of these, let me know, so I can fix it!\nAny changes to the syllabus will be documented in the changelog",

Before Bates, I was at Smith College in Physics and Statistical and Data Sciences. And long before that – before I went to school for physics and computational science – I studied philosophy, film production, and Spanish and worked in the film industry. It took me a long time to find my way to physics, but I wouldn’t change any of it. The long and winding path taught me so much more about who I am, what I am capable of, and how many opportunities are available in the world. It also taught me that it’s never too late to find a new passion or change your career direction.\nMy research involves applying high performance computing and data science techniques to many-body quantum systems, which just means studying how medium-to-large numbers of quantum objects like electrons, neutrons, or atoms interact with each other and their environment. This sounds straightforward, but unfortunately the mathematics of quantum mechanics means these problems become impossible to solve by hand and extremely challenging to solve even with high powered computers when the system is still only a few particles.\nOutside of physics, I am a person with lots of interests and hobbies. I love being outdoors in all seasons, but also love reading a book inside with a cup of tea. Ask me for book recommendations, recipes for interesting food, or great hikes in Maine!",
