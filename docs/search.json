If you do not complete it prior to class, you must work alone to finish the assignment before you can join your team. I will take into account your attendance and whether you did the PCQs prior to class when assessing your community engagement for the module.\nNot all of the work will be in groups.

Your performance on each bundle determines your base grade (by averaging the grade in each bundle using the 4-point GPA scale). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each bundle below:\nPractice\nGroup Work\nQuizzes\nExcellence\n\nGrading Scheme\n\n\nTable of letter grades\n\nLetter grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter (pts)\nPractice\nGroup Work\nQuizzes\nExcellence\n\n\n\n\nD (1.0)\nEarn &gt;= 60% average on WHWs, complete &gt;= 60% of PCQs\nAt least M on 6 Group Problems, at least M on 1 Community Engagement\nAt least M on 4\n0 Es\n\n\nC (2.0)\nEarn &gt;= 70% average on WHWs, complete &gt;= 70% of PCQs\nAt least M on 8 Group Problems, at least M on 2 Community Engagements\nAt least M on 6\n6 Es\n\n\nB (3.0)\nEarn &gt;= 80% average on WHWs, complete &gt;= 80% of PCQs\nAt least M on 10 Group Problems, at least M on all Community Engagements\nAt least M on 8\n12 Es\n\n\nA (4.0)\nEarn &gt;= 90% average on WHWs, complete &gt;= 90% of PCQs\nAt least M on 12 Group Problems, at least M on all Community Engagements\nAt least M on 10\n18 Es\n\n\n\nIf, for example, you achieved an “C” in Practice, an “A” in Group Work, a “B” in Quizzes, and got a total of 7 “Es”, your base grade would be (2.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 2.0)/4 = 2.75, which would be a B-. You could then get up to three grade round-ups.\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPoints and CompletionE/M/R/N\n\n\nHomeworks will be graded on a points scale, and PCQs on whether you completed them (regardless of “correctness”).\n\n\nQuizzes, group problems, and community engagement are graded on this scale\n\nE: exceeds expectations\nM: meets expectations\nR: revise / retry\nN: no submission\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. The number of Es you get will contribute to your overall grade (see the grading scheme)\nR and N are considered failing grades.\nIn the case of quizzes and group problems, you will have one chance to revise/retry (see more under the assignment descriptions). Community engagement cannot be revised, as it is a reflection of your participation and engagement throughout the unit.\nUnder no circumstances can you revise something you receive an N on. Remember that done is better than perfect – turn your work in so you can receive feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nPracticeGroup WorkWeekly quizzesExcellence\n\n\nPCQs: In order to get the most out of class and be a good team member, you need to prepare. To do this, we will have daily reading and pre-class questions, which are google forms that ask you a few questions about the reading and ask you to work through a warm-up problem, which you must submit prior to class start. All I ask is that you show a good-faith effort to get full credit. You do not have to solve the warm-up problem correctly, and you will go over it with your group in class.\nGiven the purpose of the PCQs, I will not offer extensions or revisions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\nWHWs: Regular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a short weekly problem set, which will be graded by a grader.\nYou may request extensions on the WHWs using the extension form.\n\nBundle grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter (pts)\nPractice\n\n\n\n\nA (4.0)\nEarn &gt;= 90% average on WHWs.

You will submit one write-up together on Lyceum, which must be type-set and clearly organized. You may type-set using LaTeX/overleaf, Google docs, or any other word processing software that can handle mathematical expressions. For each part, make sure you include at least one sentence that describes the reasoning/explanation for the math you applied. This will be graded on correctness, thoroughness, and clarity, and will receive a grade of E, M, R, or N. Group problems receiving an R may be revised once.\nYou may request an extension as a group on these problems using the extension form.\nCommunity Engagement: At the end of each module, you and your peers will fill out a form where you provide feedback on your teammates’ contributions and your own. Your self-assessment and your peers’ assessments will be weighted equally in the grade, and I will also take into account your participation in pre-class quizzes and your in-class attendance in order to determine a final grade for each module.\nThese are graded on an E/M/R/N scale. Not submitting your own form will result in an “N” regardless of how your team rates your participation.\nI recognize that group work and peer grading can be fraught. I have been in many difficult group projects myself, and as a queer woman in physics, I’m very aware of cultural and social biases that exist in our field. If there are any concerning dynamics in your group, I hope that you feel safe talking to me in addition to including that information in your feedback form. You may also fill out my anonymous feedback form and give me only the information you think I need to address this issue anonymously.\n\n\nThere will be a closed-book quiz each week on Friday. These will mostly focus on recent content, but may sometimes require that you use skills from previous units.\nIf you have to miss class or leave early on a Friday due to an approved excuse, you may take the quiz at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before the quiz is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e. starting the Wednesday before the quiz and ending the Wednesday after the quiz), and you can request this option through AESS using this form. If you are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the options.\nQuizzes are graded on an E/M/R/N scale. Each quiz will have a clear rubric of which learning objectives are being assessed and how to achieve an M or E on the quiz. There will be two opportunities to retake quizzes: once in the middle of the semester, and once during the “final exam” time slot (there is no final for this class)\n\n\nThere are 25 potential “E” grades you can earn in this class: 10 quizzes, 12 group problems, and 3 community engagement grades. Every “E” you receive will be counted in this category and goes toward your final grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading boosts\nYour base grade will be calculated from the table above, but you can round your grade up in a number of ways.\nI will apply as many grade boosts as you achieve, with one exception:\nYou can only achieve an A+ in this class if you receive a base A grade. The A+ grade does not have an impact on your GPA, and so I am reserving it as a way of acknowledging especially excellent work across the course of the semester.\n\nTime ManagementGrowthMetacognition\n\n\nIf you use no more than 3 extension requests all semester (on individual assignments), I will round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I reserve the right to round your grade up.\n\n\nIn order to get this boost, you must do 5 of the following 7 assignments:\n\nRead an article on growth mindset and reflect on how it applies to your own life\nFill out the first week of class form before the end of January\nSet a SMART goal (this will be evaluated on whether it meets the criteria) for a study skill to improve. You must do this before the end of January.\nFill out the mid-semester survey before the end of February Recess\nSchedule an appointment with a learning strategies tutor at SASC and write a reflection on one thing you learned at that meeting\nBring questions to SASC at least once and write a reflection about your experience\nCome to my office hours at least once and write a reflection about your experience\nReflect on your SMART goal at the end of the semester\n\nThese assignments will all be posted in Lyceum under the “Metacognition” tab.",

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only way I can help is if you communicate with me. Extension requests are always due before the deadline. Work submitted after the deadline without an approved extension will not be graded.\nIn general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some assignments will have stricter deadlines, which are discussed in their descriptions above.",
